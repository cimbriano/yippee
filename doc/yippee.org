* Crawler (03/19/12)
- Top-level design details
  + Chris single-threaded closely coupled with the Mercator pattern
    - Well-defined interfaces between components
    - Disk-based cache of Robots.txt (no limit)
  + Nikos multi-threaded with a different approach on the URLFrontier
    - Better than FIFO, worse than Mercator
    - Memory cache of a fixed number of Robots.txt
- Testing approach
  + Given group1 is responsible for c1 and group2 for c2
    - group1 writes white-box tests for c1 and group2 for c2
    - group2 writes black-box tests for c1 and group1 for c2
  + Both groups make sure things work as expected
  + Implementation changes don't change interface results for both groups
* Overview (03/16/12)
- Discuss and finalize interfaces between components:
  + Individual Parts:
    - Crawler: Chris + Nikos
    - Indexer: Marg + TJ
  + EC2
  + Pastry
- Contemplate pair programming/work division.
- Define unit tests to write(?).
- Figure out meeting schedule/communications.
- Evaluate project completion trajectory.

- If Indexer needs to restart: 
	* It should checkpoint the current id of the doc in the respository.
	* It (or some interface to the repsoitory) can then create an EntityCursor from the last checkpointed 
		position
